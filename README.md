# Markdowntown

Markdowntown is a simple but flexible library to convert Markdown into an `NSAttributedString`. It uses Apple's new [Swift Markdown](https://github.com/apple/swift-markdown) library to navigate through a Markdown tree and convert elements into a styled attributed string. A default set of styles are applied for quick out-of-the-box usage, but a stylesheet can be applied giving full control over how each element is styled.
